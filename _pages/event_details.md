## After Party

Billington Keep | 3PM -- ??

After the ceremony, come on back to our house to close out the afternoon with food, drink, and good company. Everyone is welcome to stick around as we get into the evening. Stay as long as you like, food and drink will keep coming as long as people stick around. 

Parking is limited by our house, so please share rides & carpool! Toronto Parking Authority will be notified that there will be extra cars in the area, but if you get a parking ticket, let us know & we'll help you out.

The cats will be sequestered in the bedroom for the course of the party. If you want to meet them, let us know! Otherwise, please do not go into the bedroom.

If you're still around by, say, 7:30 or so, we are ordering Domino's. No questions.
