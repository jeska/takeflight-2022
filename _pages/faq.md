## What's Toronto's weather like in June?

It's a toss up! It's usually quite nice during the day but gets colder in the evenings, so be prepared to throw on a sweater.

## Do you have a registry?

Nope, we are asking that you not get us gifts. Your presence is the greatest gift of all! In lieu of gifts, we would love for you to donate to one of our preferred charities:

- [CAMH](https://www.camh.ca/)
- [CEE Centre for Young Black Professionals](https://ceetoronto.org/)
- [Evergreen Brickworks](https://www.evergreen.ca/)
- [North York Food Bank](https://northyorkharvest.com/)
- [Not Far From The Tree](https://notfarfromthetree.org/)
- [Planned Parenthood Toronto](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/planned-parenthood-toronto/)
- [The 519](https://www.the519.org/)
- [The Bruce Trail Conservancy](https://brucetrail.org/)
- [True North Aid](https://truenorthaid.ca/)

If you'd like, you can include a copy of your donation in a beautiful fancy card. Check out [Not Amazon - Toronto](https://not-amazon-to.pory.app/) and click on the Stationery category to find a great local business to support.

Alternatively, make us something! We're making a bunch of things for our wedding day, and if you like making stuff, we'd love to have something unique from you to keep in our home.

## What should we wear? 

We are planning to be dressed to the nines, but we're getting married so that makes sense. For the folks who really need to put a label on it, let's call it fancy-brunch-in-the-city-casual, but ultimately you are welcome to dress in whatever makes you feel good!

## I'm staying in Toronto before or after the wedding, what is there to do?

I mean, what *isn't* there to do?? Send us a message if you want recommendations for other places to stay, food, coffee, museums, and more. 

## Does your house even have enough space for all of us?!

We hope so! If the weather is nice we'll be able to go outside into our beautiful backyard, as well. We'll keep our bedroom off limits so the kitties have a quiet place to chill, but otherwise the whole house will be open, including the basement.

## Who is making your wedding super awesome?

We're doing our best to shop local for our wedding, and we want to highlight some of the places we're using for attire, decorations, food, and more. This list will keep updating as we get closer to the wedding, so check back if you're curious!
