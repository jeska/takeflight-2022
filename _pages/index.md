Jessica David and Alex Lafortune are GETTIN' HITCHED in TORONTO on 11 JUNE 2022.

Jessica and Alex met in ye olde UT-Swing days, and now, over ten years later, they figured it was probably time to make it official. They got engaged in July of 2020 when the world was, um, a bit of a mess, so after much anticipation, they are having a small celebration with family and friends.

We are looking forward to the joy of being with y'all at our "party where we happened to get married"!
