## Getting to Toronto

For those of you coming from out of town, Toronto has two major airports:

- [Pearson International Airport](https://www.torontopearson.com/en/) (YYZ) which is serviced by pretty much every major airline & destination you can imagine.
- [Billy Bishop Island Airport](https://www.billybishopairport.com/) (YTZ) which is smaller & serviced primarily by Porter Airlines and a limited number of destinations.

If you can, we recommend flying [Porter Airlines](https://www.flyporter.com/en-ca/) for the experience, but Pearson is the most convenient in terms of flexibility & access to our hotel, venue, and house.

## Staying in Toronto

Our hotel where we have a block for a discounted rate is [Novotel Toronto](https://all.accor.com/hotel/0910/index.en.shtml). We are currently waiting on some final details before we can send out the information, so stay tuned!

Additionally, we like the [Willowdale Hotel](https://willowdalehotel.com/), which is a smaller hotel within walking distance to the venue. While we do not have a block there due to its size, it is a cute alternative!

Otherwise, if [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca/s/Toronto--ON/homes) is your thing, there are plenty of options available around Toronto as well. We'd recommend finding something in the area of Highway 401 and Don Valley Parkway.

## Transporting Around Toronto

The venue and our house are accessible by [TTC](https://www.ttc.ca/). The venue is within walking distance of Bayview Subway Station on the Sheppard line, the 11 Bayview bus, and the 85 Sheppard East bus. See the [TTC Trip Planner](https://www.ttc.ca/trip-planner) to help plan your route.

Guests are encouraged to drink responsibly and not drive after drinking in any amount. Uber, Lyft, and all major Toronto taxi companies operate in the area. We will be providing a discount code for Lyft to and from our venues & the hotel, and guests are encouraged to carpool if they can.

Parking at the Village Loft is shared with Bayview Village Shopping Centre and is plentiful and free!

Street parking at Billington Keep is free but, while seldom patrolled, is technically limited to 3 hours and not allowed overnight. All the more reason to utilize the options above!
